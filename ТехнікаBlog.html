            <h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
            <p>25/09/2023</p>
            <p>I refuse to abide by the laws imposed by websites that make it "easy" to create your own blog. True resolution and purpose comes with figure it out one step at a time, facing the hell that is coding, and shaping it all with your own, fat, sweaty, ugly hands. This is my first website, and for sure it is ROUGH and yet to be fully completed, but this is the playground which whill allow me to further my learning of programming webservers and become a successful engineer of all that is information technology. Peak austism is my strenght and an unbreakable will to beocme even more autistic.</p>

            <p>I was arrogant in thinking that making a website was easy, it is very hard.</p>
